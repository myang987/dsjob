Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Machine Learning Developer,-1,"Who we are and what we do
Mappedin powers search and discovery indoors. Our software platform provides industry leading tools for property owners and operators to manage their dynamic indoor information and build digital wayfinding experiences into their customer-facing applications.
Founded in 2011, Mappedin is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada. We work with clients in all industries around the world to help manage over 600M square feet of indoor space. In the last year, the Mappedin platform served over 140 million directions to people navigating the indoors.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you'll do
You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.
You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.
You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:
Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)
Computer Vision
Deep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/Pytorch
ML Ops
Python
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!
What are some challenges?
You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Machine Learning Developer,-1,"Who we are and what we do
Mappedin powers search and discovery indoors. Our software platform provides industry leading tools for property owners and operators to manage their dynamic indoor information and build digital wayfinding experiences into their customer-facing applications.
Founded in 2011, Mappedin is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada. We work with clients in all industries around the world to help manage over 600M square feet of indoor space. In the last year, the Mappedin platform served over 140 million directions to people navigating the indoors.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you'll do
You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.
You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.
You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:
Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)
Computer Vision
Deep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/Pytorch
ML Ops
Python
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!
What are some challenges?
You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,-1,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,-1,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
