Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as Los Angeles Metro, Houston Metro, San Antonio Metro, and Calgary Transit.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You are likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep, and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building and supporting a culture of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. We hire the best talent regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, age, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. Building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills benefits our employees, our customers, our products, and our community.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Machine Learning Developer,-1,"Who we are and what we do
Mappedin powers search and discovery indoors. Our software platform provides industry leading tools for property owners and operators to manage their dynamic indoor information and build digital wayfinding experiences into their customer-facing applications.
Founded in 2011, Mappedin is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada. We work with clients in all industries around the world to help manage over 600M square feet of indoor space. In the last year, the Mappedin platform served over 140 million directions to people navigating the indoors.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you'll do
You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.
You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.
You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:
Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)
Computer Vision
Deep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/Pytorch
ML Ops
Python
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!
What are some challenges?
You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

With the industry's most innovative business phone system, unlimited text and team messaging, one-click video meetings, and the world's most advanced AI Contact Center—Dialpad is completely transforming how the world works together.
The Natural Language Processing team in the Ai division of Dialpad analyzes customer voice and digital engagements to provide linguistic insights of business value. We build natural language understanding modules to enhance and streamline business communications, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, information extraction, intent detection, question answering and text summarization. We build our own state-of-the-art solutions using a mixture of in-house and open source technologies ranging from knowledge-engineered solutions to the very latest deep learning transformer models, while carefully considering the ethical impact of our research.
We're an eclectic group of scientists, with backgrounds in diverse fields including linguistics, computational linguistics, machine learning, computer science, materials science, biology, and quantum physics. And we work in a mix of tools and technologies - Python and Pytorch mostly, but some Keras, Tensorflow, and miscellaneous programming languages to keep things varied.
Your role
As an Applied Scientist, you will research, experiment and build natural language understanding modules to enhance business communications. You'll work closely with product engineers, designers, data engineers, data analysts, automatic speech recognition scientists, digital engagement engineers and a data annotation team. We build innovative product features based on sound science. We encourage our team members to publish and participate in academic conferences such as SIGIR, ACL, and EMNLP.

https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/dialpad
This position reports to our Manager of Applied Science. Most of the team is based in the Vancouver and Kitchener area, but we're open to remote work from within Canada or the USA.
What you'll do
In your first 30 days:
You'll work closely with your manager and an onboarding buddy to learn our technical infrastructure and our linguistic domain
Working with your buddy, you'll dig into our data and begin to make some modifications to code for extracting a linguistic ""moment"". This will get you familiar with how we develop and deploy our features. Recent projects that new hires took on during their first 30 days include flagging personally identifiable information in transcripts, formatting and extracting postal codes, and experimenting with data augmentation methods to improve a sequence labeling model
You'll attend the weekly learning seminars that our team and the speech recognition team runs to discuss the latest research on our team, papers hot off arXiv, or interesting conferences
In your first 60 days:
You'll take on a task in collaboration with another colleague. You'll do the data exploration, maybe build a prototype, and write up an experiment plan
You'll meet with our product managers to discuss how these ideas fit with the overall product, and brainstorm with UI designers about what the feature might look like in the product
You'll be invited to give an internal presentation to the other scientists about some area that interests you at one of the learning sessions
You'll spend a lot of time iterating on experiments. We try to make sure scientists and software developers have lots of meeting-free time to focus on the fun bits of the job
In your first 90 days:
You'll see your first major project move through the stages of internal deployment then into production. There's usually a period of tuning and refining when we see how things operate at scale
You'll participate in the team's brainstorming sessions as we plan for the quarter and year ahead
You might attend a conference on machine learning or computational linguistics
Skills you'll bring
A Master's or PhD degree in linguistics, computational linguistics, computer science, machine learning or equivalent practical experience and a real passion for language.
Experience conducting innovative research.
Coding experience in Python or similar.
Familiarity with Pytorch, Keras or Tensorflow.
Over the coming years we'll be extending to Spanish, French, Japanese and other languages, as well as other varieties of English, so if you have some proficiency in other languages be sure to mention it!

Machine Learning Developer,-1,"Who we are and what we do
Mappedin powers search and discovery indoors. Our software platform provides industry leading tools for property owners and operators to manage their dynamic indoor information and build digital wayfinding experiences into their customer-facing applications.
Founded in 2011, Mappedin is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada. We work with clients in all industries around the world to help manage over 600M square feet of indoor space. In the last year, the Mappedin platform served over 140 million directions to people navigating the indoors.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you'll do
You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.
You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.
You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:
Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)
Computer Vision
Deep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/Pytorch
ML Ops
Python
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!
What are some challenges?
You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,-1,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.

Machine Learning Developer,-1,"Who we are and what we do
Mappedin powers search and discovery indoors. Our software platform provides industry leading tools for property owners and operators to manage their dynamic indoor information and build digital wayfinding experiences into their customer-facing applications.
Founded in 2011, Mappedin is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada. We work with clients in all industries around the world to help manage over 600M square feet of indoor space. In the last year, the Mappedin platform served over 140 million directions to people navigating the indoors.
Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.
Who you are and what you'll do
You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.
You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.
You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:
Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)
Computer Vision
Deep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/Pytorch
ML Ops
Python
TypeScript
Test Driven Development
We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!
What are some challenges?
You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.
Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.
Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.
Behind the scenes
We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.
We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,-1,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.

Stagiaire de recherche en apprentissage automatique - Research Intern - Machine Learning,-1,"L’équipe d’apprentissage automatique du laboratoire Microsoft Research Montreal conçoit des méthodes théoriques de pointe pour élargir le potentiel d’application des systèmes d’apprentissage automatique, dans le but 1) de fournir une compréhension approfondie des principes fondamentaux sous-jacents aux algorithmes actuels et futurs, et 2) d’améliorer de vrais produits au moyen de l’apprentissage automatique.

L’équipe possède trois domaines d’intervention principaux :
Les jeux et l’IA, par la création d’outils visant à améliorer l’expérience de jeu. Notre recherche est orientée vers des disciplines telles que l’apprentissage par renforcement, l’apprentissage par imitation, le langage naturel et le raisonnement compositionnel pour la généralisation hors distribution. Nous rassemblons ces outils afin de rendre les agents artificiels plus intelligents, faciles à enseigner, compréhensibles et amusants!
Le langage, par l’exploration de la manière dont les agents d’IA peuvent utiliser le langage comme outil pour apprendre et interagir avec le monde. Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.
La généralisation et la robustesse hors distribution, par la conception de modèles capables de s’adapter efficacement à des environnements en évolution constante. Ce thème comprend des sujets tels que les architectures modulaires et réutilisables pour l’apprentissage sans exemple ou avec peu d’exemples, l’apprentissage par renforcement hors politique et hors ligne, et la détection de fausses corrélations. Nous travaillons aussi sur l’apprentissage des représentations factorisées, désenchevêtrées et causales pour les images, le langage, l’apprentissage par renforcement ainsi que le domaine médical.
De plus, nous collaborons étroitement avec l’équipe FATE de MSR Montreal, en abordant des questions telles que l’évaluation adéquate des modèles linguistiques pour l’examen des préjudices et l’utilisation d’outils d’apprentissage par renforcement et d’optimisation pour l’atténuation des dommages.

Veuillez préciser dans votre candidature les sujets qui vous intéressent le plus afin que nous puissions vous jumeler avec le projet qui correspond le mieux à vos intérêts.

The Microsoft Research Montréal Lab’s Machine Learning team develops state-of-the-art theoretically grounded methods to broaden the applicatibility of ML systems, with the goals of 1) providing a deeper understanding of the core principles underlying current and future algorithms and 2) improving real products through machine learning.

The team has three main focus areas:
Gaming and AI, building tools to improve the gaming experience. Our research covers directions like reinforcement learning, imitation learning, natural language, and compositional reasoning for out-of-distribution generalization. We bring these tools together to make artificial agents more intelligent, more teachable, more understandable, and more fun!
Language for Learning and Interaction, exploring how AI agents can use language as a tool to learn from and interact with the world. Our research directions include learning prompt-based skill repertoires, conditioning interactive agents with language and linguistic knowledge, and using grounded language models as world models. We envision AI companions that we can teach through conversation and demonstration.
Out-of-distribution generalization and robustness, designing models that can efficiently adapt to changing environments. This theme includes topics such as modular and reusable architectures for few-shot and zero-shot learning, off-policy and offline reinforcement learning, and the detection of spurious correlations. We also work on learning factored, disentangled, and causal representations for images, language, reinforcement learning as well as the medical domain.
In addition to these themes, we work in close collaboration with the MSR Montréal’s FATE team, addressing questions such as the proper evaluation of language models for harm assessment and the use of reinforcement learning and optimization tools for harm mitigation.

We ask you to specify in your application the topics that interest you the most to best match you to a project.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
