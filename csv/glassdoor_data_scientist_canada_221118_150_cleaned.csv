Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Data Analyst/Scientist - Intern,CA$25.00 Per Hour(Employer est.),"What we do
The mission of Webmainland Media Ltd is to bridge the inclusion gap between the Canadian local community and Chinese newcomers and immigrants. The company was founded in October 2015, and we started our journey by building a data-driven, cross-cultural neighbourhood engagement engine for Chinese immigrants and newcomers to access diverse local community resources by leveraging realtors’ networks and their local expertise. Chinese immigrants and newcomers can easily find their matched rental home and start their new life through the help of AI enabled community aide.
Our solutions speed up the social inclusion process for all community stakeholders. Newcomers do not need to take as long as 10 years to gain locality and feel belonged. New homeowners not just only own property, but also thrive in their communities. Locals get to know and connect with people who speak different languages and obtain opportunities to grow their businesses. Together, we create new neighbourhoods.
The Why
With the growing immigrant population and the need for diversity and inclusion, one pressing issue is the lack of connection channels between local communities and newcomers. Moreover, because of the language barrier and cultural differences, local communities cannot serve customers if they don't fully understand. In addition, the process of providing local community resources and benefits to the Chinese community/new immigrants is mostly made manually, which is very inefficient and limiting.
The R&D
To address these issues, we have gathered a group of web designers, data scientists, writers, analysts, and programmers working together to build streamlined neighbourhood engagement solutions for diverse stakeholders.
In the beginning, we build the RealtorAccess platform which allows realtors to engage with the local Chinese community and deliver their expertise directly from their desktops.
During the COVID -19 pandemic, we further our effort through the Linli Talk initiative. It is a smart social connector where neighbours are introduced to curated group gatherings to gain community updates, peer supports, matched English practice partners and diverse community resources. The Linli experience accelerates users' social integration process.
In light of the growing population of Chinese newcomers and the housing crisis, we have developed an AI-enabled community settlement aide solution, which connect newcomers with landlords to find their rental homes.
What makes Webmainland’s neighbourhood engagement experience unique is that we utilize local realtors' connections and expertise. Therefore, data is gathered, organized, and aggregated into a unified neighbourhoods database. It empowers all community stakes holders with a more cost-efficient community engagement process when the time comes.
Your Role
The primary responsibility is to provide data to customer service so that they could find matched rental homes for the end user more efficiently. The incumbent will work with a team of web/mobile app developers and business resources to build high-performing, user-friendly, DaaS applications.
Engage in the Chats to generate the conversation for data preparation
Complete the user labels and identify keywords and rules for label extracting.
Apply filters and extract data from the database to prepare customer service for daily reaching out.
Analyze success rental units and create quantified landlord persona.
Develop matching algorithms to match the rental inquiries with the landlord's rental properties from various data sources.
Develop matching algorithms to find similar rental properties for customer service’s further recommendation.
Create data visualization applications to support customer service.
Prepare documentation (e.g. Procedures/reference manuals, operating instructions, etc.) for applications.
Who You Are
Co-op students or post graduates with working knowledge of data science languages such as SQL, PowerShell, R and/or Python
Relevant educational experience in a numerate discipline or equivalent.
Extensive experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.
In addition to technical and analytical ability, you need to demonstrate capability in dealing with a wide variety of types of people and ad-hoc projects.
You need to act with quality in mind with the drive to push forward projects to completion.
Taking accountability for areas covered by the Data Science team, monitoring. performance, clearly communicating issues, developing and recommending changes where appropriate.
Needs to be assertive, and emotionally intelligent, to deal with any potentially conflicting internal agendas.
Chinese language speaking is a must.
