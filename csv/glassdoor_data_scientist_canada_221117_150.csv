Nos axes de recherche comprennent l’apprentissage de répertoires de compétences en fonction de commandes, le conditionnement d’agents interactifs à l’aide de connaissances langagières et linguistiques, et l’utilisation de modèles linguistiques concrets pour l’établissement d’une représentation du monde. Nous imaginons des compagnons d’IA à qui nous pouvons enseigner des choses grâce à la conversation et à la démonstration.",4.4,"Microsoft
